This is where i play with React Native.

## Running MyApp - Android
You'll need Android Studio installed, and the emulator running or physical device.

- Navigate to the `/myapp` directory.
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Run `npx react-native run-android` to build the app. 
- Run `npx react-native start` to fire up Metro.
